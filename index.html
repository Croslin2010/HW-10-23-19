<li>Correlation is used to find how two or more things are related.</li>
<li>Causation is when a process creates a different process as well while correlation is just two processes that seem to be effected by eachother in some way.</li>
<li>A line chart will allow you to see change over the time for the two data sets.  A coordinate plot will also do similar things to a line chart but it will be more precise yet it will be harder to compare.  Doing a combination of both could be very effective but it would be very messy.</li>
